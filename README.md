THIS IS A PROJECT THAT FOCUSES ON ANALYSING THE EFFECT OF WEARING MASKS AND BEING FULLY VACCINATED ON THE DEATH RATE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
Data sets were obtained from the WHO site as well as from Kaggle.

State-wise data was analyzed using Tableau application.

REGRESSION ANALYSIS
THE APPROACH BEGINS WITH PLOTTING A SIMPLE SCATTER PLOT. THE CONSIDERED DEPENDENT VARIABLE IS RECOVERY RATE AND THE INDEPENDENT VARIABLE IS THE COUNT OF PEOPLE FULLY VACCINATED.&#XA;

AS WE CAN SEE IN THE GRAPH ABOVE, THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE TWO VARIABLES. BELOW IS THERE GRAPH OF THE SCATTER PLOT ALONG WITH THE FITTED LINE.

SINCE THE DATA POINTS ARE CLOSE TO THE FITTED LINE, WE CAN CONSIDER THIS GRAPH TO BE A STRONG ONE. ALSO THE POINTS ARE INCREASING LINEARLY. HENCE WE CAN CONCLUDE THAT THERE IS A LINEAR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OUR CONSIDERED VARIABLES.&#XA;FURTHER, WE CAN UTILIZE THE R-SQUARES VALUE TO CHECK THE STRENGTH OF THE MODEL. THIS CAN BE PICKED FROM THE SUMMARY OF THE FITTED MODEL. FOLLOWING IS THE RESULTS OF THE CODE:

<img width="764" alt="Screenshot 2022-10-05 at 12 32 13 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67741954/194113456-7c77469a-95d6-46c3-869e-c40ff655ea66.png">

From the summary it is visible that the R-squared value for this graph is 0.8064 marked in red. This is shows that the model is strong since, R-squared value must be close to 1 and far away from 0. Hence our model is good, but not the best. The R-square value only gives the strength of the model, but in order to identify patterns and relationship between the data, we need to consider the correlation coefficient. This can be identified by plotting the correlation plot and checking the value of ‘r’. Following is a capture of the correlation plot:

<img width="767" alt="Screenshot 2022-10-05 at 12 32 44 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67741954/194113563-fd18b882-8fb3-4280-86cf-f28053a0548d.png">

THE CORRELATION VALUE BETWEEN THE DEPENDENT AND INDEPENDENT VARIABLE IS 0.90 AS MARKED IN RED FORM THE ABOVE GRAPH. THE CORRELATION VALUE SHOULD LIE BETWEEN -1 AND +1, AND ANY RELATION SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ONLY IF THE VALUE IF IT IS EITHER GREATER THAN +0.8 AND LESSER THAN -0.8. SINCE OUR VALUE IS 0.90, IT INDICATES A POSITIVE AND STRONG RELATIONSHIP.&#XA;
WE CAN ALSO SEE THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NEW_CASES AND OTHER VARIABLES AS WELL AS NEW_DEATHS AND OTHER VARIABLES CAN BE OMITTED SINCE THEY HAVE A CORRELATION VALUE GREATER THAN -0.8.&#XA;
IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR DATA SET FITS THE MODEL, THEY HAVE TO SATISFY CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS OF LINEAR REGRESSION. THIS CAN BE VERIFIED UTILIZING THE DIAGNOSTIC PLOTS.&#XA;

<img width="763" alt="Screenshot 2022-10-05 at 12 33 08 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67741954/194113633-86cec1b0-cb40-4977-a912-bf0fed57c280.png">

THE LINEARITY ASSUMPTION: THIS CAN BE VERIFIED FROM THE RESIDUALS VS FITTED GRAPH. SINCE THE FITTED LINE IS NOT LINEAR AND IS ALSO FAR FROM 0, WE CAN SAY THAT THE LINEARITY ASSUMPTION IS NOT SATISFIED.&#XA;
THE INDEPENDENCE OF RESIDUALS: THIS CAN ALSO BE VERIFIED FROM THE RESIDUALS VS FITTED GRAPH. BUT FROM THE GRAPH WE SEE THAT THE RESIDUALS ARE DEPENDENT ON THE FITTED VALUES. HENCE THIS ASSUMPTION IS ALSO NOT SATISFIED.&#XA;THE NORMALITY ASSUMPTION: WE CAN OBSERVE THE NORMAL Q-Q GRAPH IN WHICH THE GRAPH SHOWS A PRETTY STRAIGHT LINE, CONCLUDING THAT THE RESIDUALS ARE NORMALLY DISTRIBUTES. HENCE THE DATA SET SATISFIES THE NORMALITY ASSUMPTION.&#XA;HOMOSCEDASTICITY: WE NEED TO CHECK FOR CONSTANT VARIANCE IN THE SCALE-LOCATION GRAPH. ALSO THERE MUST BE NOT PATTERN FORMED BY THE FITTED VALUES. SINCE IN OUR GRAPH THERE IS A VISIBLE PATTERN FORMED BY FITTED VALUES, THE DATA SET DOES NOT SATISFY THE HOMOSCEDASTICITY. HENCE, IT IS HETEROSCEDASTIC.&#XA;
IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE R-SQUARED VALUE, WE HAVE CONSIDERED TO INTRODUCE ANOTHER INDEPENDENT VARIABLE – COUNT OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE VACCINATED. SUMMARY OF THE RESULTING MLR IS SHOWN BELOW:

WE CAN SEE THAT UPON INCLUSION OF A NEW VARIABLE, THE R-SQUARED VALUE HAS INCREASED TO 0.8375. NEXT THERE IS A NEED TO CHECK FOR LEVERAGES AND OUTLIERS. OUR MODEL DOES NOT HAVE ANY OUTLIERS, BUT CONTAINS 5 LEVERAGE POINTS. THE RESULTS ARE SHOWN BELOW:&#XA;

<img width="766" alt="Screenshot 2022-10-05 at 12 51 52 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67741954/194117170-09207ab6-4eca-47e9-a127-0d030b9da4d9.png">

IN ORDER TO CHECK IF THE LEVERAGES ARE INFLUENTIAL, WE NEED TO CHECK FOR THE DFFITS VALUE AND THE COOK’S DISTANCE.

WE CAN SEE THAT NONE OF THE POINTS ARE INFLUENTIAL, HENCE THE LEVERAGES CAN BE OMITTED FROM THE DATA SET. AFTER THE LEVERAGE WERE REMOVED, FOLLOWING ARE THE R- SQUARED VALUE AND DIAGNOSTICS PLOTS:&#XA;
